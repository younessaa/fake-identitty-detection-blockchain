# Fake Identitty Detection Using Blockchain Technology
This project aims to use the Blockchain technology to verify the
peopleâ€™s identity using the QR code of their CIN. In fact, the QR code helps
to find the complete personal information details of individuals like name and
birthday of the individual, the country where it was delivered.
The verification process can either be done by refereeing to a public
blockchain that contains all the CIN of individuals from all over the country
or passports of the international individuals. Or it can be done via the
following protocol.
